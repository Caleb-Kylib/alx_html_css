## ðŸš€ About This Project

This webpage is a tribute to minimalism and precision, inspired by a sleek Figma design from the ALX Frontend program.  
Every element â€” from typography to layout â€” was hand-coded with care to deliver a buttery-smooth experience whether youâ€™re on desktop or on the go.

**Why itâ€™s special:**  
- Fully responsive: flips to a crisp mobile design at **480px and below**.  
- Zero dependencies: no Bootstrap, no JS, just pure, semantic HTML5 and CSS3.  
- Interactive states that pop:  
  - Links glow in `#FF6565` on hover/active,  
  - Buttons subtly fade to 90% opacity, making clicks feel satisfying.  
- Max content width capped at 1000px for a clean, focused look, centered perfectly on the page.
